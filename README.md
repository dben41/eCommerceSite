eCommerceSite
=============

I had to design, implement, and document a database system for an online bookstore, written for CS 5530, my Database class at the University of Utah. This is pretty much an e-commerce site. I went above and beyond in styling and functionality, with eBay as my inspiration. While only limited code is provided here, I can provide more upon request.
